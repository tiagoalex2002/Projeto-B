 * - x: The X coordinate of the click
 * - y: The Y coordinate of the click
 * - target: The DOM node that received the click.
 * - class: This string is either 'goal-0' if the user clicked the current

 *          clicked the one following that, or else the empty string
 * - distance: The distance between the click and the center of the current
 *   target
 * - elapsed: The time elapsed since the previous click
 * - type: The type of click, either 'success', 'failure' or 'mistake'
